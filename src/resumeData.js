      "I am a master’s student in Computer Science (MSCS) with Machine Learning Specialization at Georgia Tech. I received my bachelor's degree in CS at Tech with a concentration in Intelligence and Info Internetworks. My passion lies primarily in building scalable and trustworthy AI solutions.",
      "Driven to research on robust and cost-efficient ML models and apply them to industry-ready products and services, I worked as an AI intern at GliaCloud Co., Ltd., where I develop more robust and cost-efficient machine learning models for the flagship products GliaStudio and GliaStar. At work, I also gained hands-on experience in deploying containerized microservices, building CI/CI pipelines, creating back-end APIs unit/snapshot tests for the models.",
